Expected Outcomes and Significance

We are expecting to find a positive correlation between relationship and math grades. How healthy the relationships they have with those around them should reflect positively on their grades. Findings from this project would help us get a better understanding of the importance of work-life balance. Although the data is from a Portuguese high school, it should still be a good indicator that we can apply to our own lives. Future questions that may be worth pursuing after this project would be along the lines of which variables chosen have the strongest correlation with the results. i.e. Family support having a strong relationship while family size having a negligible relationship.
