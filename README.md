## StudentGrades_Project
# DSCI 100






Expected Outcomes and Significance

We are expecting to find a positive correlation between relationship and math grades. How healthy the relationships they have with those around them should reflect positively on their grades. Findings from this project would help us get a better understanding of the importance of work-life balance. Although the data is from a Portuguese high school, it should still be a good indicator that we can apply to our own lives. Future questions that may be worth pursuing after this project would be along the lines of which variables chosen have the strongest correlation with the results. i.e. Family support having a strong relationship while family size having a negligible relationship. 

Methods

We will be performing our data analysis by splitting our data into training and testing data based on the following 10 variables out of 30 and using them to predict the students' math grades. Since our primary focus when analyzing the data is on the possible correlation between a student's relationships with others and their grades, we narrowed down our variables to:

- famsize - family size 
- Pstatus - parent's cohabitation status 
- Medu - mother's education 
- Fedu - father's education 
- romantic - romantic relationship
- goout - going out with friends 
- famrel - quality of family relationships
- freetime - free time after school 
- famsup - family educational support 
- paid - extra paid classes within the course subject

One of the ways plan to visualize the correlation between each of our 10 variables and the students' math grades is to generate ten different scatter plots - each one containing the Math grades on the y-axis and one of the 10 variables we chose on the x-axis.
